      "Marlin 6 Women's is a cross country mountain bike built to give you an efficient off-road ride with a suspension fork that locks out, and smoother-shifting 2x8 drivetrain. It's made for mountain biking, but it's also equipped with features like rack and kickstand mounts that make it a great choice for adventurous daily commutes.",
    features:
      "Smaller frames (XS and S) have a top tube that dips down as it approaches the seat tube. This design makes for a lower standover height, which is good for shorter riders because it allows them to straddle their bike more easily. The larger frames (M and ML) have a straight top tube because taller riders with longer legs typically don’t have the same issues with standover height. Marlin comes in seven frame sizes to suit riders of any height, and Smart Wheel Size ensures you’re on the fastest wheel that fits. The smallest sizes even come with short-reach brake levers and narrower handlebars that give smaller riders better comfort and control. Marlin looks and feels great. It’s packed with features usually found only on more expensive bikes, like a stylish frame with internal shift cable and brake hose routing, which can help your cables last longer by protecting them from the elements.",

      "Supercaliber 9.9 is the fastest, lightest and most capable cross-country race bike we make – and that's exactly why it's Trek Factory Racing's World Cup bike of choice. The exclusive IsoStrut top tube shock is the cornerstone of Supercaliber's efficient suspension system, giving you a fast and light ride that charges through rugged terrain at breakneck speed.",
    features:
      "Supercaliber’s unique frame design ditches traditional suspension hardware so there’s less weight, less maintenance and less lateral flex. IsoStrut connects the mainframe to the pivot-less seat stays to offer about 60 mm of rear wheel travel. This design offers a unique blend of efficiency, traction and fatigue-fighting compliance that keeps racers fresh and in control. IsoStrut integrated suspension gives you just enough travel to stay in control. It's fully tunable like a standard rear shock, but without the weight penalty of a full suspension bike. Trek's mountain-specific carbon is engineered to withstand the extreme demands of off-road racing. Advanced analysis allows our designers to create a frame with the best blend of light weight, responsiveness and just enough compliance in the seat stays to eliminate the need for a heavy rear pivot system. With 108 points of engagement, Rapid Drive gives you nearly instant acceleration instead of a clunky lag when you step on the pedals. You get smooth, immediate power to blast out of corners and hammer through the rough stuff. And that extra pedal ratchet adds control that can make all the difference when tackling a tricky climb. Knock Block has your frame's back when things go wrong. It prevents your handlebars from spinning all the way around in a crash, so your hoses won't get yanked and your controls won't hit the top tube.",

    features:
      "You like singletrack trails and want an e-MTB with a more capable full suspension set-up so you can take on more rugged adventures and stay comfortable and efficient when you do. A durable Alpha Aluminium frame that fully encases a long-life 500 Wh battery, a powerful Bosch Performance CX 250w drive system that helps you sustain speeds of up to 25 km/h and an ergonomic Purion controller. Plus, a SR Suntour XCR 34 130mm suspension fork with an adjustable air spring, a 130 mm RockShox Deluxe RL shock, a 10-speed Shimano drivetrain and hydraulic disc brakes. Full suspension lets you take on bigger, more technical trails. It's more comfortable, more efficient and faster in rough terrain. You're getting great parts and a powerful Bosch e-MTB system, but the biggest advantage of Powerfly FS 4 is the suspension package built for better riding on rugged trail adventures. Bosch's Performance Line CX motor is made specifically for off-road use with more torque and power for better acceleration. The intelligent eMTB mode automatically adjusts the amount of assist to match the terrain. It's a set-and-forget mode that delivers just the right amount of power. You get optimum control, traction and battery life so you can focus on enjoying the ride. RIB is a one-piece battery and cover with a built-in handle that can easily be removed and re-installed in the frame with no tools and no hassle. It’s the most convenient way to remove your battery for transport, security or just easier charging. Active Braking Pivot allows our engineers to tune how the suspension reacts to acceleration and braking forces independently. That means you get more confident control when you need it most. Trek's Straight Shot frame design optimises the stiffness-to-weight ratio for a more responsive ride. You'll be able to push harder and stay more planted on your line when the going gets rough. To see how far you can ride your electric mountain bike on a single charge, check out Bosch’s range calculator. We’ve auto-filled the variables for this bike model and the average rider, but you can make adjustments to get your most accurate estimate.",
